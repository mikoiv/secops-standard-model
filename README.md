# Security operations standard model

The model describes capabilities that build a complete SecOps service for an organization.

The capabilities are aligned with NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions. This is a relatively loose alignment, the main reasoning for using CSF here is to make the everything easier to group and visualize.

# 1. Identification capabilities

## 1.1. Attack surface management

Goals: understand your assets and create a continuously updating visibility to all high-risk systems, apps and assets
* 

# 2. Protection capabilities

## Security policy management

Goals: create security policies that define guardrails for your entire IT environment:
* Identity risk policies, including conditional access
* Application allow- and denylisting
* Platform resource type allow- and denylisting
* Network firewall policies, UTM policies, ACLs

MVP:

# 3. Detection capabilities

# 4. Response capabilities
