The capabilities are aligned with NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions. This is a relatively loose alignment, the main reasoning for using CSF here is to make the capabilities easier to group and visualize.

# Identification capabilities

# Protection capabilities

Goals: create security policies that define guardrails for your entire IT environment:
* Identity risk policies, including conditional access
* Application allow- and denylisting
* Platform resource type allow- and denylisting

# Detection capabilities

# Response capabilities
